Robin and Jason are meeting with Kia via Skype on 2014-07-24.  She'll be
providing an overview of the Portal's trial creation and file upload
workflow via the web interface.  We hope to get some insight into the Portal's backend infrastructure and explore alternative routes for file/data transfer ... perhaps discuss longer-term options for hosting our own repository and the handling of metadata exchange.

Kia created accounts for Robin and Jason in the [sandbox portal](http://xmaportal.org/sandbox) (a clone of the XMA portal used for testing purposes).  Robin and Jason were both made members of the `ross` group and Jason was anointed **LabAdmin** for this group.

Note that LabAdmins have the same privileges as the PI, entitling them to
create new studies and modify permissions.

Kia created a new study named [`UChicago Test Study`](http://xmaportal.org/sandbox/larequest.php?request=exploreStudy&StudyID=45&instit=SANDBOX1) for us, with Jason listed as **Study Leader**.  Robin has view access.
