# UC-XROMM

The RCC is working with [Callum Ross](http://pondside.uchicago.edu/oba/faculty/ross_c.html) and [his lab](http://rosslab.uchicago.edu/) to streamline the
the collection and publication of [XROMM](http://www.xromm.org/) (X-ray Reconstruction of Moving Morphology) datasets.

Our initial efforts will be focused on the [packaging](http://data.okfn.org/doc/data-package) of study/trial data and towards streamlining the process of submitting this data to Brown's [XMA (X-ray Motion Analysis) Portal](http://xmaportal.org/).


## Background

XROMM is a 3D imaging technology for visualizing and analyzing rapid skeletal movement *in vivo*. It combines three-dimensional models of bone morphology with motion data from biplanar x-ray video to create highly accurate re-animations of skeletal movement.

Bone motion data comes from two high-speed, biplanar x-ray movies.  Bone morphology data comes from a 3D computer model of the bone surfaces (derived from CT, laser scanning, or MRI). This motion and shape data can then be used together to generate and XROMM animation.  Rigid body kinematics inferred from the x-ray movies are applied to the bone models to re-animate the actual movement that was performed by the individual subject at the time of recording.

See Brown's [XROMM site](http://www.xromm.org/) for additional details on this particular method of analyzing skeletal kinematics.

See our [notes](portal.md) for an overview of the XMA portal.
