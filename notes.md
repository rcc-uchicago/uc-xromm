# Notes

* [Data Packager](http://ckan.org/2014/06/09/the-open-knowledge-data-packager/) - The CKAN folks developed [a web app](http://datapackager.okfn.org/) for quickly creating and publishing [data packages](https://github.com/datasets).  This is just a nice example of a clean front-end for uploading data files as a package with associated metadata.

* [Example upload script](https://github.com/ckan/example-add-dataset) -
  Example script that uses the CKAN API to create a dataset and upload some
  files to it.
