# Notes

The RCC will be hosting a testbed instance of the XMA Portal at `xromm.rcc.uchicago.edu`.  Kia will be accessing the testbed via `ssh` from IP address range `128.148.*` (`*.brown.edu`).

The XMA Portal source files are currently available in `xromm.rcc.uchicago.edu:/home/jvoigt/xma-portal-source`, which should be accessible to all RCC staff. Thatâ€™s actually a clone of Kia's bitbucket repo, so we can pull/update the source if Kia makes any changes.

The source is also available via [a private repo](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/xma-portal).  Contact [@joyrexus](https://github.com/joyrexus) for access.
