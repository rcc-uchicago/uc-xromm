# Notes

The XMA Portal source files are available via [a private repo](https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/xma-portal).  Contact @joyrexus for access.

We will be hosting a testbed instance of the XMA Portal at `xromm.rcc.uchicago.edu`.

Kia will be accessing the testbed via `ssh` from IP address range `128.148.*` (`*.brown.edu`).
